            <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
            <p>Hi! I am Vaishnavi, a Computer Science graduate with a passion for <b>full-stack 
                development </b>and creating efficient, user-centric web applications. 
                I specialize in modern frameworks such as React.js, Angular, Next.js,
                 and Express.js, and have extensive experience with cloud platforms like AWS, 
                 Firebase, and Azure, which allows me to deliver scalable, performance-driven solutions.
            </p><p>Throughout my journey, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from building seamless user interfaces to optimizing back-end systems. I’m dedicated to creating applications that are both intuitive and high-performing, always aiming to improve user experience and system efficiency.
            </p><p>
Beyond development, I find joy in painting and singing, as well as experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes. And yes, I love tasting the results of my cooking – enjoying a great meal is just part of the fun!
</p><p>
I’m always eager to collaborate on projects that combine creativity and technical expertise. Let’s work together to build something impactful!</p>
